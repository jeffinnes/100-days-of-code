## Log

### R1D1 
Worked on the readability of my blog. Mostly this involved tweaking some CSS rules.
I really wanted the date for the blog posts to show up as "X years X months X days ago" instead of just the raw timestamp from the DB. I played around with doing this in plain JS but ultimately decided to use Moment.js and its *duration* object.

### R1D2
